This is the Quickstart distribution of Drupal 7 for Pagodabox.com.

It is authored by Paul Mitchum, but of course it's developed
by a team of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands,
or dare we say it, millions?

Drupal is a trademark owned by Dries Buytaert, who originally
developed Drupal.

Drupal is available under a GNU public license. Consult drupal.org
for definitive information on licensing.

This distribution includes many contributed modules, and those
modules are also available under GPL, or they won't be included
in this distribution.
